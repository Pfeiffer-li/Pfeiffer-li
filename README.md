## Hi there 👋
🔭 Interested in blockchain technology and how it works. Currently learning about decentralized technologies such as web3 and security. If I don't contribute in github that day, that's the day I'm learning, hahaha!!

😄 The next company I'm really looking forward to finding is a company that's all about blockchain!!!

🌱 Currently Available Technology：
<br>1、Data analysis based on the Python language；
<br>2、Day-to-day Python development；
<br>3、Familiar with some simple machine learning algorithms and the construction and process of simple models: such as LR classifier and naive Bayes；
<br>4、Familiar with some knowledge of Bitcoin in the blockchain: the composition of the block, the calculation logic of hash, the overall process and principle of mining；
<br>5、Some knowledge of the Rust language, but not proficient, because the work is not used for the time being, only for their own expansion

🤔 If there is a good Rust project or blockchain project, I hope the project guru can take me！I really need you to save me.

💬 If you have some suggestions, you are also welcome to leave me a message.
